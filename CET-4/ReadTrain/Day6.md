📝 句型知识点：原因状语从句 (As/Since/Because)
使用 As, Since, 或 Because 引导的原因状语从句，是表达逻辑关系和扩展句子的基本方式。在阅读中，As 往往放在句首。
 * 结构： As/Since/Because + 完整句子 (原因), 完整句子 (结果).
 * 示例：
   * Because the system was too complex, we failed to verify the data. (因为系统太复杂，我们未能核实数据。)
   * As the market fluctuates wildly, many investors speculate cautiously. (由于市场波动剧烈，许多投资者谨慎投机。)
 * 原文拓展句 (RC A): As the algorithms are highly complex, it is difficult to justify the final score. (由于算法高度复杂，很难证明最终得分的合理性。)
Part 2: 两篇阅读理解与计时训练 (RC A & RC B)
Reading Comprehension A: 算法偏见 (The Bias in Algorithms)
【RC A 计时开始】
The increasing tendency to adopt automated decision-making in areas like lending, hiring, and law enforcement has sparked unprecedented controversy. While algorithms are often seen as objective tools, they are programmed by humans and trained on historical data, which may contain existing biases. Consequently, these sophisticated systems can unintentionally perpetuate and even exaggerate social inequalities.
For instance, if a hiring algorithm is trained on past data showing a lack of diversity, it may develop a tendency to rank diverse candidates lower, subtly distorting opportunities. As the algorithms are highly complex, it is difficult to justify the final score or decision, making those affected feel vulnerable. Experts urge developers to audit their systems rigorously and take the initiative to actively remove bias to prevent the further diminishment of fairness in automated processes.
【RC A 计时结束】
Questions for RC A (5 题)
 * What is the primary concern regarding automated decision-making systems?
   A) Their lack of speed in processing data.
   B) Their inability to distinguish between candidates.
   C) Their potential to contain and exaggerate existing biases.
   D) The high cost required to run the algorithms.
 * The word "perpetuate" (Para. 1) most closely means:
   A) to reduce or diminish.
   B) to cause to continue indefinitely.
   C) to justify or make reasonable.
   D) to take the initiative to stop.
 * Why do affected individuals feel vulnerable regarding algorithm decisions?
   A) Because the algorithms are too simple to understand.
   B) Because it is hard to justify the complex algorithm's final decision.
   C) Because the system is often too slow to provide feedback.
   D) Because the developers are taking too much initiative.
 * What action do experts urge developers to take?
   A) To simplify the algorithms so that anyone can understand them.
   B) To train the algorithms on all historical data without change.
   C) To stop using algorithms immediately in sensitive areas.
   D) To rigorously audit systems and actively remove biases.
 * The tendency to adopt automated decision-making is described as:
   A) unprecedented and controversial.
   B) conventional and expected.
   C) easy to justify.
   D) highly vulnerable to change.
Reading Comprehension B: 极简主义的兴起 (The Rise of Minimalism)
【RC B 计时开始】
Minimalism, a lifestyle initiative centered on owning only the necessities, has moved beyond design trends to become a social movement. Proponents of this philosophy argue that the conventional pursuit of more possessions does not lead to happiness, but rather to increased debt and mental clutter. By choosing to reduce clutter, individuals feel less pressure to acquire and manage things, which helps diminish stress and increases their sense of control.
This movement has been fueled by growing skepticism toward consumer culture, especially among younger generations. They are often more focused on experiences and personal freedom than on accumulating material wealth. Instead of speculateing on what the next trend will be, minimalists allocate their resources towards travel, education, and health. While some critics argue that the movement is merely a passing fad, its emphasis on sustainable consumption and intentional living suggests a deeper, more enduring shift in societal tendency.
【RC B 计时结束】
Questions for RC B (5 题)

 * The philosophy of minimalism helps individuals diminish stress by:
   A) encouraging them to speculate more often.
   B) reducing the pressure to acquire and manage many things.
   C) promoting the pursuit of the next trend.

 * What is the attitude of younger generations toward consumer culture?
   A) They are increasingly supportive of it.
   B) They show growing skepticism towards it.
   C) They are indifferent to it.
   D) They view it as an unprecedented opportunity.
 * Minimalists prefer to allocate their resources towards which of the following?
   A) Acquiring more material goods.
   B) Focusing on travel, education, and health.
   C) Following the next consumer trend.
   D) Justifying their excessive purchases.
 * The word "fad" (Para. 2) in the context of the passage most closely means:

   D) A necessary and conventional lifestyle.

目标： 训练对复杂句型的精确理解和词义的准确把握。
请您完成下面的文章翻译，并记录翻译耗时。
📖 翻译文章：教育中的长期投入 (The Long-Term Commitment in Education)
> The Long-Term Commitment in Education
> It is vital that we view education not as a single transaction but as a lifelong commitment, especially as the demands of the modern world evolve. This philosophy requires individuals to continuously adopt new skills to remain relevant and less vulnerable to economic shifts. Moreover, institutions must take the initiative to regularly update their curriculum to prevent the diminishment of their graduates' future career prospects. Without this sustained, mutual effort, it is impossible to justify the high value placed on higher learning.
