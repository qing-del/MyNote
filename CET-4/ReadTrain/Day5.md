Part 2: 两篇阅读理解与计时训练 (RC A & RC B)
Reading Comprehension A: 盲目消费与产品验证 (Blind Consumerism and Product Verification)

【RC A 计时开始】
In the age of online shopping, consumers are frequently exposed to products whose quality can be hard to verify. Marketing claims often exaggerate the effectiveness and benefits of an item, making it difficult for the average person to distinguish genuine value from mere hype. This phenomenon, known as blind consumerism, can lead to financial waste and a cycle of dissatisfaction.
Furthermore, products advertised as eco-friendly often lack the proper certification, raising concerns about sustainable practices. It is hard to justify the price without verifying the ingredients and production methods. Consumer watchdogs urge buyers to conduct thorough research, focusing on independent reviews and official documentation, before making a final purchase. Only by being proactive can individuals ensure that their money is allocated toward items that are both high-quality and ethical.

Reading Comprehension B: 城市里的绿洲效应 (The Oasis Effect in Urban Planning)
【RC B 计时开始】
As global populations increase, the density of urban centers continues to rise, making the presence of public green spaces more vital than ever. These spaces—parks, gardens, and green roofs—create an "oasis effect," offering benefits that are often invaluable to the quality of city life. They provide citizens with opportunities for recreation and relaxation, improving both physical and mental health, and boosting collective optimism.
From an ecological perspective, green spaces help sustain local biodiversity and act as natural filters, reducing air pollutants and cooling the immediate surroundings. Modern urban planners are increasingly focused on integrating these areas seamlessly into the city fabric. They recognize that the long-term sustainable success of a vibrant city depends on how effectively it can allocate space not just for buildings and roads, but for nature as well. The practice of creating and preserving these urban green initiatives is expected to emerge as a key trend in future development.
