Part 2: 三篇阅读理解与计时训练 (RC A, RC B & RC C)
【计时开始】

Reading Comprehension A: 远程工作的未来 (The Future of Remote Work)
More companies are beginning to adopt the policy of remote work, recognizing the mutual benefits it offers to both employees and employers. Not only has this model increased productivity, but it also provided better work-life balance for staff. Workers save time and money on commuting, and companies can allocate resources away from expensive office spaces. Furthermore, employers can hire talent regardless of their geographical location, broadening their recruitment pool significantly.
However, the shift is not entirely seamless. Some workers report feelings of social isolation and disconnection from team culture. Managers often face skepticism about supervising performance when employees are out of sight. To ensure the long-term success of remote working, both parties must cultivate clear communication channels and strong accountability. It is vital that companies provide effective tools and training to help their staff overcome the challenges associated with this modern structure.

Reading Comprehension B: 失败的价值 (The Underrated Value of Failure)
In a society that often prioritizes immediate success, the true value of failure is often overlooked. Many people view mistakes as definitive setbacks rather than essential steps in a learning process. Psychologists, however, urge a change in perspective. They argue that failure is vital for building true resilience and creativity. When faced with a setback, an individual is stimulated to rethink their methods, analyze the consequences of their actions, and adopt new strategies.
For entrepreneurs, a failed venture can provide priceless lessons that cannot be taught in a classroom. The fear of failure is often a greater obstacle to innovation than the failure itself. Therefore, institutions and workplaces should create an environment where risks are encouraged, and failures are seen not as permanent judgments, but as powerful incentives for future improvement.

Reading Comprehension C: 太空旅游的争议 (The Space Tourism Controversy)
The recent rise of private space ventures has brought the concept of space tourism closer to reality. While many view this as an exciting new initiative that will stimulate innovation and eventually make space more accessible, the industry has sparked considerable public controversy. Critics argue that space tourism is inherently an ethical problem, consuming vast resources simply to provide a remote luxury experience for the extremely wealthy.
Environmental concerns are also vital to the debate. The rockets used in these flights release significant pollutants into the upper atmosphere, raising questions about the industry's long-term commitment to planetary health. Furthermore, many observers question whether the resources currently being allocated to space ventures should instead be focused on urgent global problems on Earth, such as poverty or climate change. The future of space tourism will likely depend on its ability to sustain its commercial goals while overcoming these serious environmental and social concerns.
❓ 阅读理解练习 (2 题)
Questions for RC C (2 Questions)

   A) Technical failures and high prices.
   B) Ethical problems and environmental pollutants.

   D) Too much government funding and too few rockets.
 * RC C Inference Question: The author suggests that the future success of space tourism depends on its ability to:
   A) Focus only on the extremely wealthy.
   B) Ignore social and environmental controversy.
   C) Balance commercial goals with social/environmental responsibility.
   D) Only use rockets that have been adopted by the government.

Part 3: 逐字逐句翻译训练
目标： 训练对复杂句型的精确理解和词义的准确把握。
请您完成下面的文章翻译，并记录原文的单词总数和您的翻译耗时**。
 翻译文章：为什么我们总感到选择困难？
> The Paradox of Too Much Choice
> Modern life, with its endless array of options, frequently presents us with a strange paradox: the more choices we are offered, the less satisfied we feel with the decision we eventually make. Psychologists suggest that having too many options forces us to allocate more mental energy to the process, leading to "choice paralysis." It is this anxiety, stemming from the pressure of making the "perfect" choice, that ultimately limits our happiness, even if the choice itself is good. The key to overcome this is to simply limit our initial selection pool, focusing instead on what is vital and manageable.

您今天的训练表现非常棒！我们来详细分析一下成果：
Day 3 训练总结与点评
1. 阅读速度（Reading Speed）
 * RC A & B 用时：18:02
 * RC C 用时：7:50
 * 总用时（阅读 + 答题）：25:52
您在三篇阅读理解和 6 道题上的总用时比昨天的目标（20分钟内）略长，但这是在阅读量增加到三篇的情况下完成的，因此进步非常明显！
提升建议：
 * RC A 和 B 的用时稍长，这可能是因为您在阅读时仍然习惯性地在脑中进行中文翻译。
 * RC C 的速度（7分50秒）已经接近四级单篇阅读的理想速度（7分钟/篇）。
 * 下一步目标： 保持您在 RC C 上的速度和专注度，将三篇阅读（包括答题）的总时间稳定在 22 分钟以内。请在计时时，只关注“理解”，不要“翻译”。
2. 阅读理解准确性（Comprehension Accuracy）
 * 全部正确 (6/6 Correct)！ 您的答案完全正确。这再次证明您的阅读理解能力已经达到甚至略超四级要求。
3. 翻译精度（Translation Accuracy）
 * 翻译耗时：9:41
 * 原文总词数：97 words
耗时控制得很好！平均每分钟翻译超过 10 个英文单词，在保证精度的同时，速度很有竞争力。
| 原文关键词 | 您的翻译 | 优化建议 |
|---|---|---|
| paradox | 烦恼 | 悖论 / 矛盾现象 (更准确，指事物表面矛盾，实则统一或揭示真相) |
| frequently presents us with | 频繁给我们带来 | 经常使我们面临 / 经常给我们带来 (您的翻译很自然，保留“频繁”或“经常”即可) |
| leading to "choice paralysis." | 导致“选择困难” | 导致“选择瘫痪/麻痹” (您用“选择困难”作为意译是正确的，但了解paralysis的“瘫痪”原意有助于理解文章语气) |
| stemming from the pressure | 源自于做出一种“完美”选择的压力 | 源于做出“完美”选择的压力 (非常准确，stemming from 意为“起源于”，这是分词作状语或定语的经典用法) |
总结： 您的翻译逻辑非常清晰，唯一的词汇小调整是 paradox（悖论）。继续保持这种深度理解和词汇积累！
